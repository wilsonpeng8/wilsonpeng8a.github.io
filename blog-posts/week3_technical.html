  <h2>Why is JS popular in Web Development?</h2>
  <p>
    One of the reason why I had a hard time selecting the perfect bootcamp for me was because I really wanted to learn JS. I felt that Javascript was the future. I connected with a lot of alumnis, programmers, and people who are currently in the startup world and they all emphasize the importance of learning JS.
  </br>
    At first I never really understood why most alumnis graduate and become JS developers, but then I started researching into the different JS libraries out there and it seems like it's a fast paced growing language.
  </p>
  <p>
  Personally I am not a big fan of JS. I felt that it is a lot more difficult than Ruby. There are additional unecessary syntax in my opinion.

  I believe that Javascript is a very powerful language to learn because of how it can be both front end and backend. There are a lot of famous and stable Javascript libraries out there now for backend and powerful design front end stuff such as Jquery which is awesome. It is an universial language. I don't feel that Javascript have any limitation other than the fact that some of the things are still very unstable.
