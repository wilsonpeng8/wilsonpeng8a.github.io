  <h2>What I learned about Arrays</h2>
  <p>For this week's technical blog post I decided to write about Arrays and try to teach it in a way that
    most people can understand.</p>
  <p>The reason why I choose Arrays for this blog post is because I struggled with understanding how to use
    Arrays. I struggled with understanding how to get the loops in Array's working. I struggled to understand the use of Array. Then came along all the coding challenges that required Arrays especially the Pad Array exercise. After researching more into Arrays, I started to fall in love with programming and Array's in general.</p>
    <p>Array simply is a collection of data. It is a type of Data structure. It is an extremely important
      concept and tool to store data in any programming language. You can loop through array to hunt data
      or you can use it to store information.</p>

    <p>In Ruby, you can simply create an array by inserting string or integer inside two brakets like this ["item1","item2","item3"] . You can store them into a variable for instance I can call all my items grocerylist = ["item1","item2","item3"] </p>

    <p>You can do some pretty cool things with Arrays. For instance, you can find out how many items are in the array by simply using grocerylist.length , that should return 3. You can also use grocerylist.first to find out the first item of the Array. Need to know if there's something in a long list of Array? Try using include? Like this grocerylist.include?("getaway?") should return false because the grocerylist Array does not have the getaway item. Pretty awesome huh.
    </p>
    <p>Have two different list of Array that is similar that you want to combine? You can join Arrays. Want to organize your collection of Array better, feel free to explore the .split method and split the Array!</p>
