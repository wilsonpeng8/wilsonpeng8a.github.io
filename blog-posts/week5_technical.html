  <h3>Classes</h3>
  <p>Classes are important in programming. Most languages have classes and it is a great way to organize
    everything. Think of class as a wallet or a big database with a lot of data and information. </p>
    <p>An example of a class would be like an employee database with salary, name, address etc. The best way
      to create a class would be first to create a class by giving it a name for example, <br>
      class Employee
    </br></p>
    <p>This will allow us to create a new employee later by using the .new and setting it to a variable like company_A = Employee.new</p>
    <p>Next thing we would need to do is create a initialize method to start the class and it's defined as
      def initialize. We can set any parameters we like such as salary and name. </p>
      <p>Within the method we would need to set whatever parameters to instance methods so we can have access to them. All we need to do is define it. For instance, @salary = salary </p>
      <p>Finally we could end the method and create a new class the initializing process should look like this.</p>
      <p>class Employee
          def initialize(salary,name,number)
            @salary = salary
            @name = name
            @number = number
            end
            end
          </p>
