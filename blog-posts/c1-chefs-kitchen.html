  <h2>Shereef's Firechat Reflection!</h2>
  <p>I went through the entire Firechat interview and I can say that I am feeling much more confident about DBC after watching this.
    I really wished that I had access to this firechat before I applied to Dev Bootcamp, because up until I watch the video
    I had a lot of questions about Dev Bootcamp. I was uncertain and unsure why Dev Bootcamp does certain things it does.

  One of the things that I enjoyed most from the chat is how Shereef went in detail into his own personal life and went
  through the history of Dev Bootcamp. I learned a lot about how Dev Bootcamp started and why it is structured the way it
  is. The funny thing is that this firechat was able to answer ALL of my questions and uncertaintanty I had for the camp.
  I'm not nervous at all but after watching this I feel extremely pumped and excited. I can't wait to tackle more problems
  and tackle the job field later on as well.
