  <h3>Confidence</h3>
  <p>During my most happy time of my life I didn't really think about anything. I never had to worry about anything. I feel a lot of confidence in my life during that time and feel a lot of success.</p>

  <p>In General I try to be the best person I can, so I would say 5 for agree. The last time someone ask me for advice was about life situation and coding which I felt happy I could help on!</p>
  <p>I hate people who sterotype mainly because I dont believe anyone should be judging a book by its cover for no reason. Everyone has a good and bad side and it's the individual's job to show it differently.</p>
