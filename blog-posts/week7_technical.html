  <h3>NOSQL vs SQL</h3>
  <p>In this blog post I'm going to compare NOSQL vs SQL. I feel that with a lot of modern framework and applications NOSQL is rather simple. I would like to define NOSQL as a database that includes simple database operations like simple records and indexes, and that focus on horizontal. I believe that NOSQL can is very fast and can scale quite well.</p>
  <p>I believe that bigger companies will always use SQL just because there are more trained traditional database professionals. The power of SQL is that SQL is extremely stable and can scale large amount of data, but things can get extremely complicated. Most modern websites use NOSQL database like MongoDB and Redis</p>
