  <h2>Groupon</h2>
  <p>
    One of my favorite website is Groupon. Groupon is a group buying website for people who want to buy goods at a discount rate.
    One of the main reasons why I love this website is the amount of deals it has to offer for the community. I love
    saving money and Groupon helps a lot.
  

  </p>
  
  <p>
 The User Experience is wonderful. Most deals have the timer countdown which makes me feel the urgency and the need to buy
 right away. The deals are great because I'm able to try out a lot of new things for a portion of the price. The way
 I would describe this website is that it is simple, straight forward, effective, great design. When navigating the site
 I'm able to find any category I want easily. Being on this site makes me happy!
  </p>
  
  <h2>Reddit</h2>
  <p>
    Reddit is a very old school site that have been around since 2005. It is a forum with a bunch of subreddits which is like
    mini forums. I love how most of the subreddits have a huge community targeted for that specific niche. For example, when I was
    running a side business I use to read about the stories of other entrepreneurs on Reddit's entrepreneur subreddit.
    For marketing I found the marketing subreddit to be extremely useful.
  </p>
  <p>
  The site has a very old school and minimal look to it. There really isn't a strong design to the site, but I love it
  because it is simple. Some of the newer sites have really great design, but lack the simple feeling. Reddit is simple.
  One of the problems that I do find with the site is that a person who has never been on reddit might not know how to 
  explore the site. I would describe this site as very practical, knowledgable, resourceful, entertaining, and motivational.
  
  </p>
  <h2>Google</h2>
  <p>
    
  Lastly, my ultimate favorite site would have to be Google. Why? Mainly because Google is what I'm always on. When I need to 
  find an answer to something I use google. When I need a new image I use google. When I need anything like maps, I use
  Google. Google has taken over our lives and has solved almost every major painpoint in people's lives. Everyone that have
  been on the web before have used Google. Most importantly Google is what is helping me get past Phase 0!!
  
  </p>
  <p>
    
  Google's design does not stand out at all. Matter of fact it is as plain as it can get, but yet very simple. Just a search 
  bar when you land on the site. The search bar is extremely powerful and can help you find answers to anything. The way I 
  would describe google is that it is simple, effective, knowledgable, quick, and dare I say wolr dchanging. I always feel
  extremely knowledgable after being on Google. Most of the time I'm on Google to find an answer, and after a quick search
  I usually find what I need. The first thing that I'm drawn to is that search bar and I'm always leaving the site happy.
