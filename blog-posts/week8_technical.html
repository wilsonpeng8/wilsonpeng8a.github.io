  <h2>Week 8 technical blog post</h2>
  <h3>What Is Rails?</h3>
  <p>In this technical blog post for this week, I will be explaining what is Rails. Have you ever wanted to create a web app but just dont know how? Are you tired of using stuff like Wordpress, Wix and other online builders, well thankfully we have frameworks Rails. As explained on their main website, "Ruby on Rails® is an open-source web framework that’s optimized
for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It lets you
write beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration."</p>
  <p>Rails allow you to build amazing web apps on top of a programming language named Ruby. With rails you can build amazing applications for your likings. </p>

  <p>Rails run on a few philosophies. "The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:

Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.
Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files."</p>

<p>There are awesome guides out there that relate to rails such as Michael Hartl's rail tutorial. To succeed in rails one must know backend ruby as well as front end materials such as html, css, JS and many more.</p>
