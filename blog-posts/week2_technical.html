  <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
  <p>What's really weird is that I came in DBC without knowing the difference between class and ids. Actually I never
    understood the need for it. I always thought that they were made for top designers who wanted everything perfect. 
    While working on my own projects, I learned not only why I needed to use it, but the actual importance of it. 
    For instance, using DIV in general allowed me to easily design a lot of things in the css. I was organized! When it came
    to using classes vs ids it was much easier for me to access certain little things with IDs than with classes. With classes
    I'm accessing everything as a whole and editing as a whole where as with ID i can edit one single thing and toy around
    with it until it's perfect.
