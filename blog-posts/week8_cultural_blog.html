  <h2>Week 8 Cultural Blog</h2>
  <h3>Conflicts and Shame</h3>
  <p>For this week's cultural blog we will be talking about Conflicts and shame. I remember clearly when   </p>
  <p>For this blog post I would like to talk about a time where me and my previous roommate ran into a payment problem. During that time we agreed that we will be taking turns on making monthly payments for rent and fees, but he didnt pay for two months. We got in a big agrument. </p>

  <p>I yelled at him because rent is expensive and if we can't pay we will get kicked out. I didnt have enough funds to keep covering him. He was going through a tough time with his family situation where his family member was sick but I didnt know about it. </p>

<p>I also didn't know that he tried to talk to me about it but I ignored him. My actions was to yell at him which was a terrible choice of mine. If I could go back I will change everything and learn to understand the situation first. </p>
