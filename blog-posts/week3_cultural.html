  <h2>Change in Current Learning Mindset</h2>
  <p>This post will just be a reflection short post on my learning mindset. I feel that my mindset for learning has changed
    a lot throughout this week. I feel that my biggest change started when I started to do the solo assignment. Creating
    a game in JS was extremely difficult for me, but it taught me a lot of things. For example, I learned to think like a 
    developer instead of just coding and finding what works. I learned to lay down the basics and foundations first. This is
    where Psuedocoding became very useful.
    
    Right now I can say that my learning mindset has to be to break things down to basic and not jump ahead of myself. Then
    slowly grow with the knowledge and research more into each topic to make things works. It has been a tough programming
    week for me, but I learned the most this week.
