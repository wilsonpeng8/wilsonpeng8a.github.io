  <h3>OO vs. Functional Programming</h3>
  <p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), the unit of composition seems to be an object (or class). Composition is kind of like creating things as a whole in a more organize structure</p>
  <p>OOP puts code and data close together, so we want to know if data and behavior taken together can compose. I think on the other hand functional programming consist a lot of mathematical problems thats hard to explain and challenging to digest. Kind of like someone majoring in math and have to think a lot about logic. IT's more for advance backend like Scala and java.</p>
