  <h2>Week 5 Cultural Blog</h2>
  <p>This is week 5's cultural blog where I will be talking about my pair session results and feelings. I went through quite a few pair session this week and enjoyed everyone of them. Some of them I was extremely tired and felt disrespectful towards my partner because of that.
  </p>
  <p>Some of the exercise were tough but none of them were so difficult I couldn't deal with it! Me and partner tackled and research it and overcame it. I had an excellent session with a girl that helped me out a lot by explaining things well and tackled problems together. Loved it and would love to pair with her even outside DBC.</p>
